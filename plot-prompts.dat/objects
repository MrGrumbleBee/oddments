an enigma
a broken stopwatch
the scent of warm bread
half a sandwich
a pretty bauble
the detritus of lovemaking
a bent spoon
a bottle cap
jesus beams
nail clippers
a wax candle
ice
a slipper
thread
a seemingly random doodle
a child's drawing
fireflies
strange glyphs
a needle
a piece of chalk
a rubber duck
a rubber chicken
a shovel
a bookmark
a red wagon
an ox-cart
a rubber band
an old tire swing
a sharpie
a picture frame
a photo album
a nail filer
tooth paste
bath salts
an empty tissue box
cloth of gold
deodorant
a cookie jar
a rusty nail
a paintbrush
some bits of crumpled paper
a shoe lace
a no. 2 pencil
fake flowers
a sticky note
a credit card
sun glasses
a tarnished buckle
a button
a canvas
a vase
lip gloss
a rug
some kind of gel
a longbow
a crossbow
a broken arrow
a puddle
a sponge
a small boat
a loose screw
sand paper
a tin can
an aluminum can
a balloon
a spring
a silver dollar
