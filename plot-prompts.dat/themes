a bitter silence
a blessing counted
a blind spot
a bridge crossed
a call to arms
a challenge proffered
a challenge [un]aswered
a change in the weather
a chicken hatched
a cold embrace
a confession
a conspiracy
a daring enterprise
a disaster
a dish served cold
a fool and his money
a free lunch
a friend in need
a heartfelt apology
a horse of a different color
a house divided
a joy beheld
a lesson learned
a line in the sand
a little white lie
all that glitters
a loss of innocence
a love lost
a love rekindled
ambitious plans
a momentary [dis]advantage
a momentary weakness
a murderous plot
an abdication
an abduction
an act of betrayal
an act of cruelty
an act of deliverance
an act of kindness
an act of perseverance
an act of redemption
an adulterous affair
an advantageous circumstance
an apple a day
a new beginning
an execution
an extended illness
an ill wind
an indoctrination
an oath broken
another day
an ounce of prevention
an unrequited love
an unsettling revelation
an uphill struggle
a peal of wisdom
a pearl cast
a penny saved
a place to belong
a place where angels fear to tread
a port in a storm
a position of honour
a problem shared
a reluctant acceptance
a rising tide
a road less traveled
a rude gesture
a secret desire
a sense of relief
a silver lining
a slow evolution
a stirring in the loins
a stitch in time
a sudden change
a summer breeze
a theft
a troubling thought
a watched pot
a weak link
a wink and a nod
a wintry brume
a woman scorned
a word to the wise
a wrong righted
blood from a stone
confusion
deeds of the past
enmity
even the best laid plans
everyday magic
grist for the mill
in for a penny
introductions made
just enough rope
love at first sight
misplaced trust
Nature's fury
nowhere and nothing
oaths sworn
one final word
one good turn
one man's price
picking up the pieces
questions asked
that new car smell
the best defense
the better part of valour
the buttered side down
the circle of life
the company one keeps
the courage to try
the darkest hour
the enthusiasm of youth
the exception to the rule
the eye of the beholder
the folly of youth
the hypocrisy of faith
the inevitability of time and tide
the isolation of crowds
the jealousy of friends
the love of wealth
the lust for power
the many deaths of a coward
the mother of invention
the poor man's law
the rich man's law
the root of all evil
the scent of warm bread
the seeds of doubt
the sincerest form of flattery
the siren-song of despair
the soul of wit
the sound of broken glass
the spoils of war
the wisdom to know the difference
thy neighbor's love
tomorrow we die
unbroken things
