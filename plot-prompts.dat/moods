a barking dog
a bitter silence
a blessing counted
a blind spot
a bridge crossed
a call to arms
a challenge proffered
a challenge [un]aswered
a change in the weather
a chicken hatched
a cold embrace
a confession
a conspiracy
a daring enterprise
a disaster
a heartfelt apology
a horse of a different color
a joy beheld
a lesson learned
a line in the sand
a little white lie
all that glitters
a loss of innocence
a love lost
a love rekindled
ambitious plans
a momentary [dis]advantage
a momentary weakness
a murderous plot
an abdication
an abduction
an act of betrayal
an act of cruelty
an act of deliverance
an act of kindness
an act of perseverance
an act of redemption
an adulterous affair
an advantageous circumstance
an apple a day
a new beginning
an execution
an extended illness
an indoctrination
an oath broken
an ounce of prevention
an unrequited love
an unsettling revelation
an uphill struggle
a pearl cast
a penny saved
a place to belong
a problem shared
a reluctant acceptance
a rising tide
a road less traveled
a rude gesture
a secret desire
a sense of relief
a silver lining
a slow evolution
a stirring in the loins
a stitch in time
a sudden change
a summer breeze
a theft
a troubling thought
a watched pot
a wink and a nod
a wintry brume
a woman scorned
a word to the wise
a wrong righted
confusion
deeds of the past
enmity
even the best laid plans
everyday magic
grist for the mill
introductions made
love at first sight
misplaced trust
Nature's fury
nowhere and nothing
oaths sworn
one man's price
picking up the pieces
questions asked
the better part of valour
the circle of life
the company one keeps
the courage to try
the deaths of a coward
the enthusiasm of youth
the eye of the beholder
the hypocrisy of faith
the isolation of crowds
the jealousy of friends
the love of wealth
the lust for power
the scent of warm bread
the seeds of doubt
the siren-song of despair
the sound of broken glass
the spoils of war
the wisdom to know the difference
